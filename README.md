# RPS Challenge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TudorTacal/rps-challenge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TudorTacal/rps-challenge)

This project is our third weekend challenge at Makers Academy coding bootcamp. Unfortunately my time and energy were scarce but i still managed to get an MVP running.

RPS is a **web app** and allows the user to play a game of rock-paper-scissors against a computer. It uses Sinatra for running a local server and Capybara for automated testing.

### Installation and Use

1. To run the program first run **bundle install**.
2. Run **ruby app.rb**.
3. In your browser, open the link **localhost:4567**.
4. Insert your name and you will be presented with 3 buttons: rock, paper, scissors.
5. Select one of them and see if you won or lost.
